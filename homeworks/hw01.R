## Q1. Create a numeric vector called `x` with 1000 numbers. You can use any
## function or operator of your choice.


## Q2. Use `length()` to verify that `x` has exactly 1000 elements.

 
## Q3. Compute the mean, minimum, maximum and range of x.


## Q4. Create a vector called `y` that contains all the odd numbers from 1 to 100.
## HINT: There are several ways to do this. If you get stuck feel free to ask Google for help.

## Q7. If you uncomment the following two lines and run them, you'll get an
## error. Fix it.

# z = 1:5
# z[TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE]


## Q8. Generate 50 random numbers using a function like `runif()`, `rnorm()`, or
## `sample()`. Save the results to a object called `rand_nums`.

 
## Q9. Find the mean of rand_nums.


## Q10. Write an expression that returns the elements of rand_nums that are
## bigger than the average.

 
## Q11. Write an expression that returns the number of elements of rand_nums
## that are bigger than the average.
