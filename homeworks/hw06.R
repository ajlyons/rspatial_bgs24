# The end goal of this homework is to produce a map of San Francisco libraries overlaid on 
# top of San Francisco neighborhoods. The final product should look something like:

# https://github.com/ajlyons/rspatial_bgs23/blob/main/homeworks/images/hw06_map.png


## Q1. Import the SF neighborhoods. You can use the following Neighborhood boundaries GeoJSON file
##     from DataSF: https://data.sfgov.org/resource/ajp5-b2md.geojson
##     Answer: http://bit.ly/3IHQsoM



## Q02. How many neighborhoods are there?
##      Answer: http://bit.ly/3EWBxpF



## Q03. What coordinate reference system are the neighborhood boundaries in?
##      Answer: http://bit.ly/3YojH5P



## Q04. Plot the neighborhood boundaries using tmap.
##      Tip: with so many neighborhoods, you may want to hide the legend
##      Answer: http://bit.ly/3IK6kHk



## Q05. Import the San Francisco Libraries locations from the following CSV file:
##      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajlyons/rspatial_bgs23/main/notebooks/data/sf_libraries_longlat.csv
##      Answer: http://bit.ly/3IPuPmC



## Q06. How many libraries are there?
##      Answer: http://bit.ly/3KS6fnH



## Q07. Construct a SF Public libraries simple feature data frame. You can assume
##      the coordinates are geographic with WGS84 (epsg = 4326)
##      Answer: http://bit.ly/3ZlAVCa



## Q08. Plot the libraries on top of the neighborhoods
##      Answer: http://bit.ly/41NVQQ3



## Q09. Add a title to your map.
##      Answer: http://bit.ly/41JqvxO




## Q10. Make an interactive version of your map
##      Answer: http://bit.ly/3KWw45R
##      Tip: Interactive maps don't always work well in R Notebooks. Run your code from a script or 
##      the console instead.
