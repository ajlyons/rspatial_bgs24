## Q1. Load the `maps` package into memory.



## Q2. The maps package comes with a dataset called `world.cities`. What kind of object is 'world.cities'?
  


## Q3. How many rows and columns does `world.cities` have?



## Q4. What is the original data source of world.cities?
##     Hint: datasets have help pages too!

## Q09. Use `runif()` to generate 20 random numbers uniformly distributed between 100 and 200.



## Q10. Rewrite the following expression with pipes. You can use either the
## traditional pipe (`%>%`) from the magrittr package, or the more recent native
## pipe (`|>`)

sum(round(rnorm(n = 200, mean = 50, sd = 5)))
