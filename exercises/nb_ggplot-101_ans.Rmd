In this notebook, we'll get some practice making plots with ggplot using the [Palmer Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) dataset.

# Setup

Load packages and set conflicted preferences:

```{r chunk01, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

## Load the conflicted package
library(conflicted)
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
conflict_prefer("count", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
conflict_prefer("select", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
conflict_prefer("arrange", "dplyr", quiet = TRUE)
```

\

Next, we load the Palmer Penguins data frame:

```{r chunk02}
library(palmerpenguins)
glimpse(penguins)
```

\

# Scatterplots

Our first ggplot will be a simple scatterplot of bill length and flipper length:


```{r chunk03}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

\

Next, change the color of the dots by manually specifying a color value in the geom function:

```{r chunk04}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue")
```

\

Next, we color them by species:

```{r chunk05}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

\

Don't like the default colors (which are not color-blind friendly)? We can specify our preferred palette by tacking on `scale_color_manual()` to our expression:

```{r chunk06}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4")) 
```

# CHALLENGE 1

1A\) Make a scatterplot with *bill depth* on the x-axis and *body mass* on the y-axis. [[Answer](https://bit.ly/3bKiYtB)]

```{r chunk07}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()
```

\

1B\) Visualize your plot of *bill depth* vs. *body mass* by species, using different i) colors, and ii) shapes. [[Hint](https://bit.ly/3C00mjY)] [[Solution](https://bit.ly/3pcHeaL)]

```{r chunk08}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

\

# Facets

Another way we can differentiate the points is by using *facets* (i.e., a separate plot for each group). We can ask for facets by adding `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()` to our plot expression: 

```{r chunk09}
ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~species)
```

\

# Boxplots

You can use `geom_boxplot()` to draw boxplots. 

To  create multiple boxplots for different groups of data, pass a column that has categorical (character or factor) values as either the `x` or `y` property in `aes()`. ggplot will take care of the rest!

```{r chunk10}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

\

# CHALLENGE 2

Make a histogram of flipper length for each species. [[Hint](https://bit.ly/3pfmEqm)]  [[Solution](https://bit.ly/3pjcfJX)]

```{r chunk11}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~species)
```
